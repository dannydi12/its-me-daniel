I'm serious. 

I consumed half a tub of vanilla coconut ice cream before coding this.

Let me give you some context:
- I use Obsidian, a markdown editor, for all of my notes. I find it to be a great place to quickly write out long-form thoughts and keep them organized.
- This site was built with Remix, a speedy server-side rendering framework for React.
- I really wanted to take some of my notes in Obsidian and publish them to this website.

Now that you're all caught up, you'll realize that setting up a pipeline between the two isn't always straight forward. My notes are stored in iCloud and I wasn't about to pay $100 a year for an Apple Developer Account just to access CloudKit to load my markdown files on the server. 

So I decided to use Github instead via this cool Obsidian plugin that allows you to push certain files to a repository. So now, all my markdown files that I've marked for publishing automatically get pushed to a specific folder in this website's repo and trigger a new build in Vercel.

Then those markdown files get parsed into HTML via remark js and shipped to the client + stored in the Vercel CDN cache.

Pretty neat right? Now you can load these blog posts in under x ms. 

Which leaves you with more time to eat your ice cream before it melts ðŸ˜”
